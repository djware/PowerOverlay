# PowerOverlay
Screen overlay that displays time, battery percentage, and ETA of battery time left. 

This program is written in C# and can be used to display how much battery time you have left on your device. Swiping from the top of the screen (20 pixels are less) and downward will either make the overlay appear or disappear.

It will appear on most games and full screen apps. Howver, it may not work on some.
